### Comments

Nice job with functionality, everything works as it should. You also do very well with
your variable/property/method/class/etc naming. All names are descriptive.

Just as you split the creation of the animal array into a helper method, consider doing
the same for your setup of the button and image views. That methd could be called
configureButtonsAndImageViews() or something like that, and would handle lines 32-49.

For the description variable in your Animal struct, instead of:

    var description: String {
        var description = ""
        description += "name: \(self.name)\n"
        description += "species: \(self.species)\n"
        description += "age: \(self.age)\n"
        return description
    }

You can just write:

    var description: String {
        return "name: \(self.name)\nspecies: \(self.species)\nage: \(self.age)\n"
    }

If you want it to be more clear with the newlines, Swift supports multiline strings, 
indicated by the triple quotes """:

    var description: String {
        return """
               name: \(self.name)
               species: \(self.species)
               age: \(self.age)
	       """
    }
